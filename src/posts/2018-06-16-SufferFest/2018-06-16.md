It was another sunny day in Zagreb☀️ so [Marko](http://markohrastovec.com), [Hrvoje](http://www.hrvojemihajlic.com/) and I decided to go on another sufferfest on mountain near Zagreb called Sljeme. It is one of our favorite routes as the ascent is on a fire road called Gorscica and downhill is thru 18-20 and then at the end Dotrscina which is a local xc trail. 

Hrvoje made a cool video from the ride so check it out 😎
