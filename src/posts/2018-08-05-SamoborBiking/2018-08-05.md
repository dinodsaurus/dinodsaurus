It was a lazy weekendee so [Marko](http://markohrastovec.com), [Hrvoje](http://www.hrvojemihajlic.com/) and I decided to visit our friends Lovro and Miro at ‚õ∞Ô∏è[Samobor](https://www.samobor.hr/) and see what their local trails got to offer. The trail is called Slava gora and can be found on [trailforks](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/slava-gora-mtb/). The trail is nicely built and maintained so I can really recommend it to anyone who finds himself near Samobor and wants some proper MTB enduro action.

Special thanks to Hrvoje for making a great video(again).ü§ô
