After some traveling I have finally found some time to do a bit of mountain biking with the squad.

## Hot Reactor cycling

Our first enduro race is in 3 weeks and we created a race team called Hot Reactor cycling (basically [Marko's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-hrastovec-2709b6155) company is called Hot fonts and mine is [Reactor](https://www.reactor.studio/), very creative I know ðŸ˜‰) so we went to the trails to check them out.. and it was awesome!

We even met some people from Bulgaria and guided them on our local trails.

Next week I will go to Istria for some more riding so stay tuned!
